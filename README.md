Project Description:

Prophet is a powerful time series forecasting library for Python developed by Facebook's Core Data Science team. It is designed to handle time series datasets with multiple seasonalities, changing trends, and holiday effects. Prophet is built on top of a decomposable time series model with three main componentsâ€”trend, seasonality, and holidays.

The project covers:

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Twitter stock price data.
- Interactive plots for data analysis using Plotly.
- The Prophet model in Python for time series forecasting of the Twitter stock price data.
